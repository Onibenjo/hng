# BUG REPORT ON Timbu.com
_My HNG Internship Trip_

 This is my bug report on the [Timbu's](https://timbu.com) webpage for the hng internship program.
 
 

## THE MENUÂ BAR
Most of us are pretty familiar with responsive Web design by now. Basically, it uses a combination of a fluid layout and media queries to alter the design and layout of a website to fit different screen sizes.

 On smaller screen sizes, clicking the menubar doesn't pop up the menu.
 

## THE FOOTER
Social Links: The link to their facebook is not functional.
Navigation links: Apart from the countries link under the LOCATIONS section, all other links are not functional.



## NEWSLETTER
Subscribing to their newsletter returns a page with a 200 text.
